I attempted the second extra credit question.  Both scatterplot.js and generalized_scatterplot.js contain the same basic code except that generalized_scatterplot.js references the file stats.csv which contains MLB player statistics from the 2023 MLB season (code is available at https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/custom?year=2023&type=batter&filter=&min=q&selections=player_age%2Cpa%2Chome_run%2Ck_percent%2Cbb_percent%2Cb_rbi%2Cwoba%2Cxwoba%2Csweet_spot_percent%2Cbarrel_batted_rate%2Chard_hit_percent%2Cavg_best_speed%2Cavg_hyper_speed%2Cwhiff_percent%2Cswing_percent&chart=false&x=player_age&y=player_age&r=no&chartType=beeswarm&sort=xwoba&sortDir=desc). In this case, I have filtered the results based on being 25 years old.

in both cases, references to the labels (titles and axis), domains (including any special formatting function), and any sieve (which performs the filtering).  To switch to this code, the index.html file needs to be changed; the source (src) in the script must be changed to generalized_scatterplot.js from scatterplot.js.
